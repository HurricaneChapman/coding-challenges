**Hi Spotify!**

There's an html and a javascript file here. The JS file contains the solution. The html file loads it and displays the result, if you'd like to see it. No webserver needed, it'll run on a hard drive. 

Written in ES6, so use a browser that understands it natively, like Chrome.

Thank you very much for taking the time to look.
